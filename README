h1. Wicked!

wicked.js is a module manager. It allows to load external scripts that contain one 
function and allow to chache its code using localStorage for faster future loading.

h2. Example

Given your script wants to load a function "test()" which is located at "http://example.com/test.js",
you can use the following code:

mg = new Wicked;
mg.get('test','http://example.com/test.js',function(mod){
  alert('test() has been loaded');
});

The "mod" parameter is the "test()" function which can be now executed.

h2. Requirements

* localStorage
  This is pretty much supported by all modern browers + IE8.
